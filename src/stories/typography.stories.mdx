# Text styles

The main fonts used across all Creative Commons' sites are Source Sans Pro and Roboto Condensed. Both are available on
Google Fonts, support a wide range of languages, and were designed to be displayed digitally.

The text styles defined should be used depending on the content displayed. For titles and short-length calls, Roboto
Condensed is the option. For long reads and descriptive sentences, Source Sans Pro. To not to risk the content
legibility, Roboto Condensed was adapted by adding 2% of kerning. In both cases, the main color for white background is
DarkSlateGray color.

Depending on the situation, some styles can be adapted having in mind that the number of styles implemented should keep
simple. The criteria used to apply Roboto or Source Sans Pro for titles must put legibility over aesthetic. Based on
that, we created title styles for both fonts.

## Headings

Headings of type A need no additional classes to be used. They directly apply to all heading tags from `<h1>` to `<h5>`.

<Typeset
  fontSizes={[
    '3.56rem',
    '2.25rem',
    '1.75rem',
    '1.43rem',
    '1.25rem'
  ]}
  fontFamily="Roboto Condensed"
  fontWeight={700}
  sampleText="HEADING A" />

Headings of type B need the class `.b-header` to be applied to heading tags from `<h3>` to `<h5>`.

<Typeset
  fontSizes={[
    '1.75rem',
    '1.43rem',
    '1.25rem'
  ]}
  fontFamily="Source Sans Pro"
  fontWeight={700}
  sampleText="Heading B" />

## Body

By default, body text in `<p>` tags is rendered at the base font size.

<Typeset
  fontSizes={[
    '1.00rem'
  ]}
  fontFamily="Source Sans Pro"
  fontWeight={400}
  sampleText="Body" />

Body text can be made big or bigger with the eponymous `.body-big` and `.body-bigger` classes on the `<p>` tag.

<Typeset
  fontSizes={[
    '1.43rem',
    '1.12rem'
  ]}
  fontFamily="Source Sans Pro"
  fontWeight={400}
  sampleText="Enlarged body" />

Captions can be rendered with the class `.caption` on the `<p>` tag.

<Typeset
  fontSizes={[
    '0.80rem'
  ]}
  fontFamily="Source Sans Pro"
  fontWeight={400}
  sampleText="Caption" />

Values can be rendered with the class `.value` on the `<p>` tag.

<Typeset
  fontSizes={[
    '4.37rem'
  ]}
  fontFamily="Roboto Condensed"
  fontWeight={700}
  sampleText="42" />

Code can be rendered with the class `.monospace` on the `<p>` tag.

<Typeset
  fontSizes={[
    '0.875rem'
  ]}
  fontFamily="Fira Code"
  fontWeight={400}
  sampleText="const x = () => { console.log('Hello World!') }" />
