# Measures

To create a consistency in elements position and harmony, we defined a unit base that applies to the grid, margin and
paddings. Based on this unit, we generated a list of spacings that applies in the layout of any page.

The basic distance defined in Vocabulary is 16 pixels. This measurement corresponds to 1 rem and generates eight
variations to support all the possible distances. Those spacings range the smallest distance like text margins, and the
largest ones like margin between sections.

## Spacing definitions

| Name    | SCSS variable    | rem  | px |
|---------|------------------|------|----|
| Smaller | `$space-smaller` | 0.25 | 4  |
| Small   | `$space-small`   | 0.5  | 8  |
| Normal  | `$space-normal`  | 1    | 16 |
| Big     | `$space-big`     | 1.5  | 24 |
| Bigger  | `$space-bigger`  | 2    | 32 |
| Large   | `$space-large`   | 2.5  | 40 |
| Larger  | `$space-larger`  | 3    | 48 |
| XL      | `$space-xl`      | 4    | 64 |
| XXL     | `$space-xxl`     | 6    | 96 |

# Usage

To use the spacings in your code, you can
- use the helper classes in your markup for the most common use-cases
- import `spacing.scss` and use the SCSS variables directly in your stylesheets

Spacing applies to two properties (margin and padding) on four sides (top, right, bottom and left). For each spacing
size and each property we have two kinds of helper classes:
- directed i.e. `.<property>-<direction>-<size>`<br/>
  Applies the spacing only towards the given directions.

  | Direction | Options                          |
  |-----------|----------------------------------|
  | Side      | `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` |
  | Group     | `horizontal`, `vertical`         |

- undirected i.e. `.<property>-<size>`<br/>
  Applies the spacing on all four sides of the element.

**Example:**

```html
<div class="margin-horizontal-big">
  <!-- Margin of 1.5rem on left and right sides -->
</div>
<div class="padding-small">
  <!-- Padding of 0.5rem on all four sides -->
</div>
```
