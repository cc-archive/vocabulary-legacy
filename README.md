In essence Vocabulary is a component library that uses and extends [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS library.
Vocabulary makes it easier to develop Creative Commons apps while ensuring a consistently familiar experience.

## Usage

We've tried to make it as easy as possible to use Vocabulary in your projects. Depending on your build pipeline you
might prefer to install Vocabulary via `npm` or via a CDN.

### NPM

For a full fledged app, use `npm` (or if you're one of those people, `yarn`) to install Vocabulary.


#### Installation

Just install `@creativecommons/vocabulary` using the package manager of your choice.

```bash
npm install @creativecommons/vocabulary
```

### CDN

To start using Vocabulary for quick prototyping or development you can use one of our CDN-based deployments. Both CDNs
mirror our `npm` deploys so choose either one based on your personal preference.

#### Stylesheets

Just link to the master CSS file with any of these one-line `link` tags within your document `head` tag.

#### unpkg

```

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@creativecommons/vocabulary@1.0.0-beta.6/css/vocabulary.css"

 or, if you prefer the latest version, use 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@creativecommons/vocabulary/css/vocabulary.css">
```

#### jsDelivr

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@creativecommons/vocabulary@1.0.0-beta.6/css/vocabulary.css">

 or, if you prefer the latest version, use

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@creativecommons/vocabulary/css/vocabulary.css">
```
