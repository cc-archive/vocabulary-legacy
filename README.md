### Contributing


**[GitHub repository](https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary")**

We're always looking for contributors to help us find and fix bugs, build new 
features, help us improve the project documentation or translate the project to
another language.

Vocabulary is continuously evolving and improving. You can contribute to the
project in a number of ways.

| What | How |
|-|-|
| **Code**      | If you are a developer, feel free to resolve open issues, proof PRs, add new features to existing components or add new components altogether. |
| **Design**    | If you are a designer, your inputs on making every component more intuitive, aesthetic and joyful will reverberate through the entire ecosystem. |
| **Test**      | If you are a user of these components, your feedback, bug reports and feature requests will drive the project forward so that we can meet your needs. |
| **Translate** | If you speak a language other than, and in addition to, English, you can help make the project accessible to your community with your words. |
| **Write**     | If you have a knack for writing technical articles, you could be the voice of the library's documentation, making it easy to use and understand. |
| **Share**     | If you can't contribute in these ways, you can refer the project to a friend who might be able to. Spreading the word is the easiest way to help out. |

If you're interested, read the file `INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the 
repository for instructions regarding contributing to the project.
