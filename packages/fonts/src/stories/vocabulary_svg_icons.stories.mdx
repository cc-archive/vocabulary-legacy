# Vocabulary icons

Vocabulary Icons is a set of SVG icons for use in Vocabulary, a cohesive design system to unite the web-facing
Creative Commons. Some of the icons are taken from  [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com).

SVG icons are light-weight and scalable, and offer all the benefits of styling with CSS just like a regular font.
They are smaller than fonts in size. In addition, you can include in your build only the icons you actually need,
or even just copy and paste an icon without the long build step. SVG icons are also much more accessible than icon
fonts, as they don't have a corresponding code-point, and can have semantic titles.

## Usage

You can choose the icons you need from the gallery below. There are three ways you can use the icon:

1. Download the SVG file and use it as any other image file.

2. Copy the path of the SVG icon, and add it in your code like this:
```
import ChevronUp from '@creativecommons/fonts/svg/chevron-up.svg?inline'
<ChevronUp />
```
To use this way, you have to configure your webpack loaders.
In a Nuxt.js app, you can use [Nuxt svg module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/svg-module).
In a React app, you can configure 'raw-loader', and in a Vue app you can use [Vue svg loader](https://vue-svg-loader.js.org/).

3. Copy the SVG source string, and paste it inline into your code.
