# Usage

We've tried to make it as easy as possible to use Fonts in your projects. Depending on your build pipeline you
might prefer to install Fonts via `npm` or via a CDN.

## NPM

For a full fledged app, use `npm` (or if you're one of those people, `yarn`) to install Fonts.

Just install `@creativecommons/fonts` using the package manager of your choice.

```bash
$ npm install @creativecommons/fonts
```

In your entrypoint, you can include the master CSS file. It does not include the Accidenz Commons font, so you might
want to import that separately.

```js
import '@creativecommons/fonts/css/fonts.css'
```

## CDN

To start using Fonts for quick prototyping or development you can use one of our CDN-based deployments. Both CDNs
mirror our `npm` deploys so choose either one based on your personal preference.

Just link to the master CSS file with any of these one-line `link` tags within your document `head` tag.

#### unpkg

```html
<!-- If you have a specific version in mind, use -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@creativecommons/fonts@1.0.0-beta.3/css/fonts.css">
<!-- or, if you prefer the latest version, use -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@creativecommons/fonts/css/fonts.css">
```

#### jsDelivr

```html
<!-- If you have a specific version in mind, use -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@creativecommons/fonts@1.0.0-beta.3/css/fonts.css">
<!-- or, if you prefer the latest version, use -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@creativecommons/fonts/css/fonts.css">
```

## Individual imports

If you want to import individual fonts instead of importing them all at once, replace `fonts.css` in either of the above
methods with any of the following:

- `vocabulary_icons.css`
- `source_sans_pro.css`
- `roboto_condensed.css`
- `accidenz_commons.css`
- `jetbrains_mono.css`
