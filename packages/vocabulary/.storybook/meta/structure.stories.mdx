# Why is Vocabulary a monorepo?

> The tool for managing the monorepo in Vocabulary has been extracted out as [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

`Vocabulary` follows a monorepo approach. All maintained modules are a part of the same repository.

## Rationale

-  The three repositories have a  **strong**  dependency chain so storing them together makes some implicit sense.
-  The relation between a `2020.8.1` release of `Fonts` and a `2020.8.5` release of `Vocabulary` is arbitrary.
-  The release process is long, convoluted, and involves releasing each project manually in line from `Fonts` to `Vue-Vocabulary`.  
-   Documentation is scattered across 3 repositories, making it harder to create internal links.
-   Unified documentation & the landing site could then be placed in the monorepo.

### Pros

- Unfified Lint, Run, Build & Release Processes.
- Easier management of dependencies across your packages.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place for easier code review of features that span more than one package.
- Easier to setup a development environment.
- Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules more easily.

### Cons
 * Codebase looks more intimidating.
 * Repository is bigger in size due to the presence of individual packages.
 * Difficult to account for previous individual contributions (git histories) within the same repository.

## Conclusion

`Vocabulary`, `Fonts` and `Vue-Vocabulary` are now packages present in one _unified_ monorepo. They are however, separate npm packages.
