# Overview

## What is Vocabulary?

Vocabulary is the web design system for the [Creative Commons](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/) brand. It provides styles and components that will be used across all Creative Commons websites to ensure attractive and consistent design.

The overall Vocabulary project consists of:
- **Design Library** ([Figma](https://figma.com)), the source of truth for all designs in Vocabulary
- **Fonts** (Typefaces), which provides typefaces and the main icon font for use in the system
- **Vocabulary** (CSS library and assets), which provides base CSS styles for all components.
- **Vue Vocabulary** ([Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) library), which provides Vue components derived from Vocabulary

## Why does Vocabulary exist?

We aim to have a consistency in design and development (that works as the base of CC brand) across all major Creative
create a cohesive brand identity for CC, which will both improve user experience and drive more awareness of our work
to donors.

We need a common set of styles to use across all these websites to make this happen in an efficient and maintainable
manner.

## Principles

### Principle 1

> **Every CC website will be based on Vocabulary.**

#### Meaning
- If there’s a new design element needed for a website, the **UX designer** needs to be consulted and create a design in Figma first.
- Developers will need to add items or update designs in Vocabulary and then pull the latest version of Vocabulary into their own code.

#### Rationale
- To ensure consistency and maintainability
- To ensure maintainability by restricting websites to using only shared code for styling.
- One person bottlenecks all major design changes.

#### Tradeoffs
- Lack of opportunity for individual creativity.

### Principle 2

> **Vocabulary will provide only the styles and components needed for real use cases.**

#### Meaning
- All components in Vocabulary should have a real world use case. If they are not used, they should not be in
  Vocabulary.
- Vue Vocabulary will only contain Vue components that are used in a CC website that uses Vue. This means that not all
  components in Vocabulary will have a corresponding Vue Vocabulary component.
  - If using the CSS from Vocabulary is the same amount of code as using a custom Vue component, we will use the CSS
    directly and skip the Vue component.
- We will not create additional Vocabulary libraries similar to Vue Vocabulary; we’ll use the base CSS styles instead
  for other systems like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/).
  - WordPress and Lektor do not support standalone components like Vue. We will only create Vocabulary libraries for
    systems that support standalone components if needed.
- Vocabulary will not offer special styling for combinations of basic elements.
  - For example, Vocabulary may include separate elements for tables and text boxes, but will not include special
    styling for the combination of a text box inside a table.
  - Complex components like header and footer which are relevant to CC branding will be an exception to this rule.

#### Rationale
- To keep the maintenance burden as low as possible by maintaining only a minimum viable set of styles and components.
- To ensure that designs are created with a real use case in mind. Theoretical designs often don’t stand up when
  introduced to the real world.

#### Tradeoffs
- Vocabulary or Vue Vocabulary may look a little sparse.
- Vocabulary will not be very customizable or extensible.

### Principle 3

> **Vocabulary will have the same set of components in both Figma and the web.**

#### Meaning
- Each component in Figma needs to have a corresponding set of stories in Vocabulary. The titles should match exactly.
- Vocabulary should offer the same variety of components as Figma as much as it is feasible to do so.
- Figma should clearly separate the styles of basic elements and patterns from documentation on how those elements and
  patterns can be combined.
  - For example, Figma should offer colors as elements in the Design Library, but the way to use those colors well
    should go in the documentation section.
- Vocabulary should embed the relevant Figma component in the documentation for that component.

#### Rationale
- To reduce confusion and ensure that the relationship between the designs in Figma and the web are absolutely clear.

#### Tradeoffs
- Lack of customizability for different use cases.

### Principle 4

> **Vocabulary will provide documentation on the approved ways to use components.**

#### Meaning
- Design documentation provided in Figma needs to be provided in Vocabulary through Storybook Docs and/or Figma embeds.
- All components need to have some explanation about what they are and how they are used.

#### Rationale
- To provide context around components and offer guidelines for their use to build consistent websites.
- To allow developers to create designs in approved ways without needing sign-off from the design and product team for
  every single change.

#### Tradeoffs
- Work needed to keep this documentation updated.

## Discussions

Conversations around Vocabulary happen primarily in the (private) `#ux-design` channel and the (public) `#cc-dev-vocabulary` channels in [Slack](https://creativecommons.slack.com). The tech team is consulted on proposed design changes on an ongoing basis. We may also talk about Vocabulary in the (internal) biweekly Design-Product sync meeting or call other meetings as appropriate.
