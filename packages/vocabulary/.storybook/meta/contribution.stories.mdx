# Contribution

We're always looking for contributors to help us find and fix bugs, build new features, help us improve the project documentation or translate the project to another language.

Vocabulary is continuously evolving and improving. You can contribute to the project in a number of ways.

| What       | How                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code**   | If you are a developer, feel free to resolve open issues, raise PRs, add new features to existing components or add new components altogether.        |
| **Design** | If you are a designer, your inputs on making every component more intuitive, aesthetic and joyful will reverberate through the entire ecosystem.      |
| **Test**   | If you are a user of these components, your feedback, bug reports and feature requests will drive the project forward so that we can meet your needs. |
| **Write**  | If you have a knack for writing technical articles, you could be the voice of the library's documentation, making it easy to use and understand.      |
| **Share**  | If you can't contribute in these ways, you can refer the project to a friend who might be able to. Spreading the word is the easiest way to help out. |

The following instructions are in addition to the processes in our general [Contribution][contribution] and
[Pull Request][pull_request] guidelines on the Creative Common Open Source website. If you haven't read them already,
read them first.

[contribution]: https://creativecommons.github.io/contributing-code/
[pull_request]: https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/pr-guidelines/

These instructions are a port of the general guidelines, tailored specifically for Vocabulary.

## Setting up

Clone the repository. If you intend to contribute, which you should, fork the repo from GitHub's GUI and clone your fork instead. See GitHub Help pages for [instructions on how to do that](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

To setup you can either use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or manually set up the project. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.

Docker makes sure every developer has a consistent and identical development setup. It also removes the entire hassle involved in dependency management. On the other hand, it is heavy and hits system resources particularly hard.

Manual setups are lightweight, tweakable and much more performant as the code runs very close to the operating system. On the other hand, all dependencies must be manually resolved and each developer has a different setup.

Vocabulary is a monorepo containing multiple packages. The manual approach also allows for working on multiple packages simultaneously.

### Docker and Docker Compose

Install Docker and Docker Compose, if you don't already have them on your computer.

Bring up all services.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

To run `npm` commands, you'll need to enter a Vocabulary container.

```bash
$ ./docker/vocabulary/run.sh
docker-desktop:/codebase$ ...
```

If you install new packages, you'll need to rebuild a few things.

```bash
$ docker-compose down
$ docker volume prune
$ docker-compose build storybook
```

### Manual setup

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), if you don't already have them on your computer. 

Install dependencies in the root project:

```bash
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
$ npm run setup
$ npm run build
```

Start the following processes in different terminals:

- SCSS build process: watches SCSS files and rebuilds them if any of them change
- the Storybook process: interactive playground of components in the browser

```
$ npm run watch
$ npm run storybook
```

## Discussing changes

For bugs reports and feature requests, use GitHub issues with the appropriate labels. We can discuss the possibility of that change or new feature being implemented and released in the future. This lets us come to an agreement about
the proposed idea before any work is done.

## Assigning work

If the issue is already assigned to somebody, it is considered polite to give the last assignee a week's time to  attempt it before you do. You can express an intention to work on it nonetheless so that it can be reassigned to you if the last assignee bails.

Submitting PRs without commenting your intent to solve an issue is risky because if someone else does ask to work on it before your PR comes in, your PR will be put on hold for a week.

## Making changes

Do all work on its own branch. Use meaningful branch names.

**Examples**

- `broken_links_readme`
- `typo_misspelled`

Use clean commit messages, as imperative sentences in the present tense.

**Examples:**

- Remove the broken links from the \`README.md\` file
- Fix the typo on line 12, where 'misspelled' was misspelled as 'mispelled'

Update your fork from time to time. See GitHub Help pages for [instructions on how to do that](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).

Write new tests, and update existing ones, for the changes you make.

## Testing

While our [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) setup will prevent you from committing poorly linted code, it cannot catch logical problems. For
that we have some tests.

### Unit

Running unit tests is easy.

```bash
$ npm run test:unit
```

### Visual regression

Visual regression tests are slightly more complex. They run in a Docker container to prevent OS differences from
affecting the screenshots.

Create a new file `docker/puppeteer/env_vars` in which to hold environment variables. Add the `STORYBOOK_ORIGIN`
environment variable corresponding to the OS you're using.

```bash
# macOS
STORYBOOK_ORIGIN=http://host.docker.internal:8080
# Linux
STORYBOOK_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
```

Build the container.

```bash
$ docker build \
    --tag puppeteer:latest \
    --file docker/puppeteer/Dockerfile \
    .
```

Start by running the Storybook. You can use your preferred method from the [Setting up](#setting-up) section to do so.
Once you have the Storybook server running, run the commands as shown below.

```bash
$ ./docker/puppeteer/run.sh
pptr@docker-desktop:/codebase$ npm run test:snapshot
```

To update screenshots, after you've written some new tests or updated failing ones, run the same commands as earlier
with `-- -u` appended to the end of the `npm run` command. The `--` is a special construct that allows passing arguments
to `npm` scripts, which we're using the pass the `-u` (or `--updateSnapshot`) flag to Jest.
