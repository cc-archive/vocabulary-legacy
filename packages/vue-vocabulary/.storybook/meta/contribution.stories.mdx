# Contribution

We're always looking for contributors to help us find and fix bugs, build new features, help us improve the project documentation or translate the project to another language.

Vue Vocabulary is continuously evolving and improving. You can contribute to the project in a number of ways.

| What | How |
|-|-|
| **Code**      | If you are a developer, feel free to resolve open issues, proof PRs, add new features to existing components or add new components altogether. |
| **Design**    | If you are a designer, your inputs on making every component more intuitive, aesthetic and joyful will reverberate through the entire ecosystem. |
| **Test**      | If you are a user of these components, your feedback, bug reports and feature requests will drive the project forward so that we can meet your needs. |
| **Write**     | If you have a knack for writing technical articles, you could be the voice of the library's documentation, making it easy to use and understand. |
| **Share**     | If you can't contribute in these ways, you can refer the project to a friend who might be able to. Spreading the word is the easiest way to help out. |

The following instructions are in addition to the processes in our general [Contribution][contribution] and
[Pull Request][pull_request] guidelines on the Creative Common Open Source website, and [those] in Vocabulary. If you
haven't read them already, read them first.

[pull_request]:https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/pr-guidelines/

These instructions are a port of the general guidelines, tailored specifically for Vue Vocabulary.

## Setting up

Clone the repository. If you intend to contribute, which you should, fork the repo from GitHub's GUI and clone your fork instead. See GitHub Help pages for [instructions on how to do that](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

To setup you can either use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or manually set up the project. Both have their advantages and
disadvantages.

Docker makes sure every developer has a consistent and identical development setup. It also removes the entire hassle
involved in dependency management. On the other hand, it is heavy and hits system resources particularly hard.

Manual setups are lightweight, tweakable and much more performant as the code runs very close to the operating
system. On the other hand, all dependencies must be manually resolved and each developer has a different setup.

### Docker and Docker Compose

Install Docker and Docker Compose, if you don't already have them on your computer.

Bring up all services.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

To run `npm` commands, you'll need to enter a Vue Vocabulary container.

```bash
$ ./docker/vue-vocabulary/run.sh
docker-desktop:/codebase$ ...
```

If you install new packages, you'll need to rebuild a few things.

```bash
$ docker-compose down
$ docker volume prune
$ docker-compose build storybook
```

### Manual setup

Install Node.js and NPM, if you don't already have them on your computer.

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Start the Storybook process which is an interactive playground of components in
the browser:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run storybook
```
