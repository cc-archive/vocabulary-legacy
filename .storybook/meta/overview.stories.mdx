# Overview

## What is Vocabulary?

Vocabulary is the web design system for the Creative Commons brand. It provides styles and components that will be used
across all Creative Commons websites to ensure attractive and consistent design.

The overall Vocabulary project consists of
- **Design Library** (Figma), the source of truth for all designs in Vocabulary
- **Fonts** (Typefaces), which provides typefaces and the main icon font for use in the system
- **Vocabulary** (CSS library and assets), which provides base CSS styles for all components.
- **Vue Vocabulary** (Vue.js library), which provides Vue components derived from Vocabulary

## Why does Vocabulary exist?

We aim to have a consistency in design and development (that works as the base of CC brand) across all major Creative
create a cohesive brand identity for CC, which will both improve user experience and drive more awareness of our work
to donors.

We need a common set of styles to use across all these websites to make this happen in an efficient and maintainable
manner.

## Principles

### Principle 1

> **Every CC website will be based on Vocabulary.**

#### Meaning
- If there’s a new design element needed for a website, the **UX designer** needs to be consulted and create a design in
  Figma first.
- Developers will need to add items or update designs in Vocabulary and then pull the latest version of Vocabulary into
  their own code.

#### Rationale
- To ensure consistency and maintainability
- To ensure maintainability by restricting websites to using only shared code for styling.

#### Tradeoffs
- Lack of opportunity for individual creativity.

### Principle 2

> **Vocabulary will provide only the styles and components needed for real use cases.**

#### Meaning
- All components in Vocabulary should have a real world use case. If they are not used, they should not be in
  Vocabulary.
- Vue Vocabulary will only contain Vue components that are used in a CC website that uses Vue. This means that not all
  components in Vocabulary will have a corresponding Vue Vocabulary component.
  - If using the CSS from Vocabulary is the same amount of code as using a custom Vue component, we will use the CSS
    directly and skip the Vue component.
- We will not create additional Vocabulary libraries similar to Vue Vocabulary; we’ll use the base CSS styles instead
  for other systems like WordPress and Lektor.
  - WordPress and Lektor do not support standalone components like Vue. We will only create Vocabulary libraries for
    systems that support standalone components if needed.
- Vocabulary will not offer special styling for combinations of basic elements.
  - For example, Vocabulary may include separate elements for tables and text boxes, but will not include special
    styling for the combination of a text box inside a table.
  - Complex components like header and footer which are relevant to CC branding will be an exception to this rule.

#### Rationale
- To keep the maintenance burden as low as possible by maintaining only a minimum viable set of styles and components.
- To ensure that designs are created with a real use case in mind. Theoretical designs often don’t stand up when
  introduced to the real world.

#### Tradeoffs
- Vocabulary or Vue Vocabulary may look a little sparse.
- Vocabulary will not be very customizable or extensible.

### Principle 3

> **Vocabulary will have the same set of components in both Figma and the web.**

#### Meaning
- Each component in Figma needs to have a corresponding set of stories in Vocabulary. The titles should match exactly.
- Vocabulary should offer the same variety of components as Figma as much as it is feasible to do so.
- Figma should clearly separate the styles of basic elements and patterns from documentation on how those elements and
  patterns can be combined.
  - For example, Figma should offer colors as elements in the Design Library, but the way to use those colors well
    should go in the documentation section.
- Vocabulary should embed the relevant Figma component in the documentation for that component.

#### Rationale
- To reduce confusion and ensure that the relationship between the designs in Figma and the web are absolutely clear.

#### Tradeoffs
- Lack of customizability for different use cases.

### Principle 4

> **Vocabulary will provide documentation on the approved ways to use components.**

#### Meaning
- Design documentation provided in Figma needs to be provided in Vocabulary through Storybook Docs and/or Figma embeds.
- All components need to have some explanation about what they are and how they are used.

#### Rationale
- To provide context around components and offer guidelines for their use to build consistent websites.
- To allow developers to create designs in approved ways without needing sign-off from the design and product team for
  every single change.

#### Tradeoffs
- Work needed to keep this documentation updated.

### Principle 5

> **All designs must be approved by our UX Designer; it is not sufficient to use Vocabulary.**

#### Meaning
- Any significant design changes or new designs must be approved by the **UX Designer** before being implemented, even if
  they are based on existing Vocabulary components.

#### Rationale
- This will provide the best user experience for our users.
- All designs are vetted by an expert.

#### Tradeoffs
- One person bottlenecks all major design changes.

## Workflow

## Roles and responsibilities

### Roles

#### Comms Manager

The Comms Manager owns the CC Style Guide. Vocabulary follows the Style Guide from the perspective of colors
and styles, it does not inform the Style Guide. Any implementation of web styles (for example, color choices) that are
at odds with the Style Guide must be properly justified and discussed with Victoria for sign-off. It is crucial that CC
maintains a consistent brand and style experience throughout.

#### UX Designer

The UX Designer maintains the Figma Design Library, which is used for designing mockups. When experimenting
with changes to Vocabulary, they are first done in Figma and surfaced to the team. Francisco is responsible for making
suggestions for how Vocabulary can be improved, in light of how things look when it is integrated on CC web properties.
He is also responsible for defining layout-specific styles within Vocabulary. He also runs point on proposing
web-specific UI styles as needed. If there is no conflict with the Style Guide (i.e. these are additive, not
contradictory), then sign-off falls to Anna. Otherwise, Victoria is consulted.

#### Director of Product

The Director of Product (DoP) is responsible for final review and sign-off on all design changes, prior to
implementation.

#### Director of Engineering

The Director of Engineering (DoE) is responsible for the technical architecture and project management of Vocabulary,
with input from CC staff developers and the community maintainer.

#### Community Maintainer

The Community Maintainer is responsible for releasing new versions of Vocabulary, triaging issues, and managing
community contributors to Vocabulary. He also makes changes to Vocabulary and provides technical input on Vocabulary as
needed.

#### Web Developer

The Web Developer is responsible for making changes to Vocabulary and maintaining the WordPress themes that use
Vocabulary. He also helps with new releases of Vocabulary, managing community contributors to Vocabulary and providing
technical input on Vocabulary as needed.

#### Frontend Developer

The Frontend Developer is responsible for making changes to Vocabulary and Vue Vocabulary. He also helps with
new releases of Vocabulary, managing community contributors to Vocabulary and providing technical input on Vocabulary
as needed.

#### Community contributors and interns

Community contributors and interns work on pre-approved open GitHub issues in Vocabulary. They may also make
suggestions for design or technical changes, which must be approved by Anna and Francisco, or Kriti, respectively.

## Discussions

Conversations around Vocabulary happen primarily in the (private) #ux-design channel and the (public) #cc-dev-vocabulary
channels in Slack. The tech team is consulted on proposed design changes on an ongoing basis. We may also talk about
Vocabulary in the (internal) biweekly Design-Product sync meeting or call other meetings as appropriate.

## Workflows

### New website design

- The developer working on the website design creates wireframes and discusses with the **UX Designer** and the
  **Director of Product**
  - A wireframe is a representation of the content displayed with gray tones to separate sections/zones. It is focused
    on content and navigation.
- The **UX Designer** works with the developer to create high-fidelity mockups in Figma using Vocabulary components.
  - A mockup has the brand and graphic definitions with interaction notes. It is focused on the look-and-feel.
- The **Director of Product** approves the mockups.
- The **UX Designer** adds any new components used in the mockup to the Design Library.
- The developer adds new components or updates existing components in Vocabulary (and Vue Vocabulary, if appropriate)
- The developer uses the updated version of Vocabulary to build the website.


### Technical architecture change

- The developer suggesting the change creates a GitHub ticket and tags Kriti in it for approval.
- The **Director of Engineering**, at their discretion, consults with the **Web Developer**, the **Frontend Developer**,
  and/or the **Community Maintainer** and makes a decision and communicates it on the
  GitHub ticket.
- The ticket is either implemented or closed.

### Design change

- The person suggesting the change creates a GitHub ticket and tags the **Director of Product** and the **UX Designer**
  in it for approval.
- The **Director of Product** and the **UX Designer** make a decision on whether to approve it.
- If approved, the **UX Designer** updates the Design Library with the new design.
- The change is then implemented in Vocabulary (and if needed, Vue Vocabulary)
- A new version of Vocabulary is released.
- All projects using Vocabulary pull in the latest version so that the design change is reflected everywhere.
