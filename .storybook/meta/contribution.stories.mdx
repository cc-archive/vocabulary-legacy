# Contribution

We're always looking for contributors to help us find and fix bugs, build new
features, help us improve the project documentation or translate the project to
another language.

Vocabulary is continuously evolving and improving. You can contribute to the
project in a number of ways.

| What | How |
|-|-|
| **Code**      | If you are a developer, feel free to resolve open issues, proof PRs, add new features to existing components or add new components altogether. |
| **Design**    | If you are a designer, your inputs on making every component more intuitive, aesthetic and joyful will reverberate through the entire ecosystem. |
| **Test**      | If you are a user of these components, your feedback, bug reports and feature requests will drive the project forward so that we can meet your needs. |
| **Write**     | If you have a knack for writing technical articles, you could be the voice of the library's documentation, making it easy to use and understand. |
| **Share**     | If you can't contribute in these ways, you can refer the project to a friend who might be able to. Spreading the word is the easiest way to help out. |

The following instructions are in addition to the processes in our general [Contribution][contribution] and
[Pull Request][pull_request] guidelines on the Creative Common Open Source website. If you haven't read them already,
read them first.

[contribution]:https://creativecommons.github.io/contributing-code/
[pull_request]:https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/pr-guidelines/

These instructions are a port of the general guidelines, tailored specifically for Vocabulary.

## Setting up

Clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary.git
$ cd vocabulary/
```

If you intend to contribute, which you should, fork the repo from GitHub's GUI and clone your fork instead.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/vocabulary.git
$ cd vocabulary/
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary.git
```

To setup you can either use Docker and Docker Compose or manually set up the project. Both have their advantages and
disadvantages.

Docker makes sure every developer has a consistent and identical development setup. It also removes the entire hassle
involved in dependency management. On the other hand, it is heavy and hits system resources particularly hard.

Manual setups are lightweight, tweable and much more performant as the code runs very close to the operating
system. On the otuer hand, all dependencies must be manually resolved and each developer has a different setup.

### Docker and Docker Compose

Install Docker and Docker Compose, if you don't already have them on your computer.

Bring up all services.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual setup

Install Node.js and NPM, if you don't already have them on your computer.

Install dependencies.
```
$ npm install
```

Start the following processes in different terminals
- SCSS build process: watches SCSS files and rebuilds them if any of them change
- the Storybook process: interactive playground of components in the browser

```
$ npm run watch
$ npm run storybook
```

## Discussing changes

For bugs reports and feature requests, use GitHub issues with the appropriate
labels. We can discuss the possibility of that change or new feature being
implemented and released in the future. This lets us come to an agreement about
the proposed idea before any work is done.

## Assigning work

If the issue is already assigned to somebody, it is considered polite to give the last assignee a week's time to attempt
it before you do. You can express an intention to work on it nonetheless so that it can be reassigned to you if the last
assignee bails.

Submitting PRs without commenting your intent to solve an issue is risky because if someone else does ask to work on it
before your PR comes in, your PR will be put on hold for a week.

## Making changes

Do all work on a its own branch. Use meaningful branch names.

**Examples**
- `broken_links_readme`
- `typo_misspelled`

Use clean commit messages, as imperative sentences in the present tense.

**Examples:**
- Remove the broken links from the \`README.md\` file
- Fix the typo on line 12, where 'misspelled' was misspelled as 'mispelled'

Update your fork from time to time.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream master
$ git push origin master
```

Write new tests, and update existing ones, for the changes you make.

## Testing

While our Husky setup will prevent you from committing poorly linted code, it cannot catch logical problems. For
that we have some tests.

### Unit

Running unit tests is easy.

```bash
$ npm run test:unit
```

### Visual regression

Visual regression tests are slightly more complex. With the Storybook process turned off, run the following command to
run visual regression tests.

```bash
$ npm run test:snapshot
```

If you have the Storybook server running, you can run use the alternate command below.

```bash
$ npm run jest:snapshot
```

To update screenshots, after you've written some new tests or updated failing ones, run the same commands as earlier
with `-- -u` appended to the end of the command. The `--` is a special construct that allows passing arguments to
`npm` scripts, which we're using the pass the `-u` (or `--updateSnapshot`) flag to Jest.
